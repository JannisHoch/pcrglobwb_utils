Time functions
=========================

Output from PCR-GLOBWB (particularly discharge) is often at the daily resolution.

In case statistics or aggregations in time are needed, those functions could be used:

.. currentmodule:: time_funcs

With these methods:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   :nosignatures:

   calc_montly_avg
   daily2monthly
   daily2yearly
